# React Create App Quickstart
> Template for a minimal React app


## About

- A simple React scaffold, including setup instructions.
- Use as a reference for new or existing applications.
- Add a copy to your repos with _Use this template_ button.
- This project is based on the files generated by React CLI's [create-react-app](#create-a-fresh-project) command.


## Documentation

Follow the setup instructions using this repo a template copied to your own repos.

Then you can run a start command to build and run the app, then you can view the app in the browser.

See [docs](/docs/README.md).


## How it works

- A React app typically runs as a Node.js server, especially locally. This uses a compile step and runs from memory - there is no _build_ directory used.
- The app can be compiled to a _build_ directory for running as a static site - this means you can deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- React uses `.js` or `.jsx` files with _JSX_ syntax (HTML inside JavaScript). These cannot be run directly. But these are transpiled (or compiled) to plain JavaScript by the `react-script build` command. Babel is used for that transpiling, but it is not necessary to use specify it directory as it is covered through the direct dependencies.


## Create a fresh project

From [Getting started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

Run the `NPM` command which required [Node.js](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/aa1fc56419a355972b96bce23f3bccba) to be installed.

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```

## Dev notes

- It is better to set state through a method rather than by changing state directly.
- The Foo component is based on part of this video: [Get started with React in under 10 minutes](https://youtu.be/K02AkMbV1HM)
- This project uses 3 main dependencies, which were included with the quickstart
    - `react` - for the core application.
    - `react-dom` - for using `ReactDom` in [App.js](/src/App.js).
    - `react-scripts` - used to setup the `script` commands in [package.json](/package.json).
- There are 3 testing libraries - these were moved to dev dependencies.
- When running the `build` command, the `NODE_ENV` value will be set to `production` by React - see [React docs - Adding custom env variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).
- Homepage
    - The `homepage` value is set `package.json` and used on the build - see `index.html` in the output includes `src="/react-create-app-quickstart/static/js/..."` for example.
    - This is necessary for GH Pages build to work correctly on a subpath.
    - It doesn't seem to matter whether the value is just `/react-create-app-quickstart/` or the full `https://michaelcurrin.github.io/react-create-app-quickstart/`.
    - Customize this value for other repos.



## License

No license until I can figure out how the create quick start from React should be licensed. And if I should use the original NPM package's license as this is a major part.
