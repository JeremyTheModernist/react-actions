# React Create App Quickstart
> Based on the React Create App template


## About

- A simple React scaffold
- Based on the React quickstart app that is generated by the React CLI's `create-react-app` command.
- Instructions are provided to create an fresh app or use create a Github repo immediately using this template.


### How it runs

- React's `.js` or `.jsx` files cannot be run directly - you need to use Babel as part of React's install and run flow.
- A React app typically runs as a Node.js server, especially locally.
- The app can be compiled to a build directory for running as a static site - this means you can deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify.


## Get a React project

### Use this template

Click the button on the repo.

Follow the install and usage instructions below in [Run locally](#run-locally)


### Create a fresh project

From [Getting started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

Run the `NPM` command which required [Node.js](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/aa1fc56419a355972b96bce23f3bccba) to be installed.

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```
