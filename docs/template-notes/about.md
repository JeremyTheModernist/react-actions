# About


## Features

- A simple React scaffold, including setup and run instructions. This project is based on the files generated by the React CLI's [create-react-app](#create-a-fresh-project) command.
- Use as a reference for new or existing applications.
- Add a copy to your repos with _Use this template_ button.


## How to use this project

Create a new repo from the _Use this template_ button on the [README.md](/README.md). That will fork it to your own repos.

Follow the instructions in the docs linked below to install and run the app, so you can view it locally in your browser.


## Origin

This project was created using:

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
```

The app is mostly unchanged but I've added detailed docs and a GH Actions deploy flow to get the site hosted on GH Pages.


## How a React project works

- A React app typically runs as a _Node.js_ server, especially locally. This uses a compile step and runs from memory - there is no `build` directory used.
- The app can be compiled to a _build_ directory for running as a static site - this means you can deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- React uses `.js` or `.jsx` files with _JSX_ syntax (HTML inside JavaScript). These cannot be run directly. But these are transpiled (or compiled) to plain JavaScript by the `react-script build` command. Babel is used for that transpiling, but it is not necessary to use specify it directory as it is covered through the direct dependencies.
